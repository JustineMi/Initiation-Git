# Justine, newbie dev junior

Hi, an Arlonaise who just arrive in Li√®ge.
I came here for start training, firt as a *fleurist*, and now as a *dev*.

My most surprising skills :
1. Draw
2. Being friend with all cats
3. Can read korean

Things I like the most :
**1. Cats**
**2. Video Games**
**3. Read**

If I'm here, I want to learn to be a frond end developer.
And understand more about html, css and Javascript

I have a fear of drowning

The things you look forward to ? My future, I guess ?

For good team work, we need:
1. *Communication*
2. *Sympathy*
3. *Listen each other*
